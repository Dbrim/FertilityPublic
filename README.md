# FertilityPublic
This is a public repository to show the code used for my analysis of the co-movement between fertility and business cycles in select African countries. Unfortunately, because the data was acquired through the DHS, I cannot share the full repository, and this code will not run on its own. It is still the best example of my coding ability as of May 2018, although I continue to learn new coding etiquette and techniques.

Essentially, I have already shrunk 38 files from the DHS website. In this file, I clean the data, combine two different types of datasets, and panelize the data that was originally introduced as a cross-section. After doing this, I merge the fertility data with GDP data for the relevant countries, create new variables, and run numerous specifications geared at understanding the cyclicality of fertility in these countries and understanding potential mechanisms to explain this relationship. In this analysis I conclude that fertility is pro-cyclical in these countries, and that this relationship is primarily driven by young mothers with only a primary education.
